A game for people that stare at Windows Spotlight images too much. Created with React.

## Get Started

Prerequisites -
npm (12.0.0^)

Clone the repository and cd into the directory. Run `npm install`.

In the project directory, you can now run:

### `npm run start`

This will open a local web app to play the game. Only a single user is currently allowed to write to the firebase db.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br />

## TODO

- Better support of types
- More metrics
- Testing
- Refactor firebase updates to single source
